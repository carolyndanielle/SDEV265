# DnD Character Management Tool - Project Proposal

## Project Overview
The **DnD Character Management Tool** is a proposed web-based application designed to assist Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) in managing character sheets more effectively. The tool will include essential features such as character creation, stat tracking, inventory management, and save/load functionality. It will be developed using Python for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, and will integrate a database to store and retrieve character information. The application is intended to be accessible on computers, offering a user-friendly interface that enhances the gameplay experience for all users.

## Objectives
- **Streamline Character Management**: Provide DnD players and DMs with a convenient, centralized tool to manage character sheets digitally.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Develop a responsive and intuitive web interface that allows users to easily create, update, and manage their characters.
- **Ensure Data Persistence**: Implement a reliable database system to ensure character data is securely stored and can be retrieved for future sessions.
- **Support Seamless Integration**: Ensure smooth integration between the frontend and backend to deliver a cohesive and efficient user experience.

## Features
- **Character Creation**: Users can create and customize DnD characters with fields for name, race, class, and initial stats.
- **Stat Tracking**: The tool will allow users to update and track character stats as they progress through the game.
- **Inventory Management**: Users can manage their character's inventory, including adding, removing, and viewing items.
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Character data will be stored in a database, allowing users to save their progress and load it during subsequent sessions.
- **Web-Based Access**: The tool will be accessible through any web browser on computers, providing flexibility and convenience.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.x with Flask framework
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Database**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL, depending on project requirements)
- **Data Management**: SQLAlchemy (Python ORM)

## Project Scope
- **Frontend Development**: Design and implement the user interface using HTML and CSS, focusing on usability and responsive design.
- **Backend Development**: Develop the core functionalities using Python and Flask, including character creation, stat tracking, inventory management, and database integration.
- **Database Integration**: Set up and manage the database to ensure secure and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that all features work as intended and meet the projectâ€™s quality standards.

## Team Roles
- **Patrick (Front-End Developer)**: Responsible for designing and implementing the user interface using HTML and CSS. Patrick will focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface that aligns with the needs of DnD players.
- **Daniel (Back-End Developer)**: Focuses on developing the core backend functionalities using Python. Daniel will implement modules such as character creation, stat tracking, and data management, and will integrate the database with the backend.
- **Carolyn (Team Lead & Back-End Developer)**: Oversees the entire project, ensuring that deadlines are met and the project stays on track. Carolyn will also contribute to backend development, particularly for complex features like inventory management and save/load functionality, and will handle integration between the frontend and backend, as well as database management.

## Risk Management
The project team has identified potential risks and will employ mitigation strategies to ensure project success:
- **Schedule Risk**: Regular progress reviews and task prioritization to avoid delays.
- **Performance Risk**: Continuous testing and optimization to ensure the tool meets performance standards.
- **Scope Creep Risk**: Strict adherence to the defined project scope to prevent unnecessary expansion of features.

## Conclusion
The **DnD Character Management Tool** is a valuable project that will provide significant benefits to the DnD community by simplifying character management. The project plan outlines a clear path to successful development, with a well-defined timeline, technology stack, and team roles. The team is committed to delivering a high-quality product that meets the needs of its users, and looks forward to the successful completion and deployment of the tool.
